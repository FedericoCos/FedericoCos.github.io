### 1. Nailed It
A 2D platform game in Unity developed for the course "Video game Design and Programming" at Polimi.
The focus was to create a novel gameplay mechanic. The main idea around the game is to mix a platform game with
point&shoot mechanics.

The team was composed by:
- Costantini Federico (me): Group leader and programmer
- Zaanca Federico: programmer
- Xie valerio: artist
- Sas Alexandro: artist
