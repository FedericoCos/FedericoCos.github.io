## Game Development

### 1. Nailed It
*Developed for the "Video Game Design and Programming" course at Politecnico di Milano.*

{% include feature_row id="project_nailed_it" type="left" %}

**The Concept:**
"Nailed It" mixes classic platforming with a unique point & shoot mechanic. In this world, platforms are often missing. To progress, you must **shoot nails** into the environment or **nail your own character** to walls, using your past bodies as steps to reach new heights.

**My Role:** Group Leader & Gameplay Programmer.
* **Tech Stack:** Unity (2D), C#.
* **Key Contribution:** Designed the core "nailing" physics mechanic and managed the Git workflow for the 4-person team.

**Team:**
* **Costantini Federico** (Leader & Programmer)
* **Zaanca Federico** (Programmer)
* **Xie Valerio** (Artist)
* **Sas Alexandro** (Artist)
