### 1. Nailed It
A 2D platform game in Unity developed for the course "Video game Design and Programming" at Polimi.
The focus was to create a novel gameplay mechanic. The main idea around the game is to mix a platform game with
point&shoot mechanics \\ The team was composed of four people:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Costantini Federico (me): Group leader and programmer
    \item Zaanca Federico: programmer
    \item Xie valerio: artist
    \item Sas Alexandro: artist
\end{itemize}
